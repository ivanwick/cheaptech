<p>
cheappod allows you to download songs from your ipod back to a computer.

My computer caught on fire shortly after finishing this so I probably won't do much work on it until I fix my laptop or get a new computer that runs Mac OS X.  In any case, I think it's complete feature-wise (hence the "1.0") and it's definitely usable. So... my loss is your gain!
</p>

<p>
<strong>Tip:</strong> drag songs out of cheappod's song list directly into your iTunes library. It works!

There's also something of a "<a href="cheappod.html">standard-format software presentation webpage</a>" when it comes to software intended for use on apple computers. (you can also call it the apple hipsters page)
