# cheaptech

Around the end of my undergraduate studies at UCSD, I built my personal projects under the brand cheaptech.

The name was meant to be a self-aware acceptance of how limited these small projects were, either in quality, or general usefulness. I was inexperienced and constrained for time, but wrote software to fill my own niches.

I didn't know many people interested in these projects and didn't announce them publicly. They were only linked from my ~ivan user page on the UCSD BIOGEM website, so almost nobody saw them. Incidentally obscurity was also a great way to avoid criticism.

My last work under the cheaptech brand roughly coincided with when I left San Diego.
