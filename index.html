The problem with this project is that while having an AirPort base station would help me write and test the program, having an AirPort base station also invalidates my need to write and test this program.

This one could be instructive if you needed an example of basic LWP usage. and possibly a good example of silent, unhelpful error handling.

<a href="grab-1.0.zip">Grab</a> for Windows<br/>
Loosely modeled off of the Grab.app utility on Mac OS X. Allows you to quickly and easily "grab" a section of the screen (i.e. the "PrtScn" key with some extra features).<br/>
Download includes source code (VB6 project) and an executable Grab.exe. To use, run Grab.exe and drag a rectangular selection over your screen. You should then get a popup menu with some options.<br/>
caveats: doesn't support multiple monitors very well (by which I mean 'at all'). The way the selection rectangle is implemented is pretty cheap. Also it doesn't look like it works in XP without CommDlg32.ocx, which you may need to download.

Reveal the desktop.
Mac OS X users will find this familiar and probably useful.
